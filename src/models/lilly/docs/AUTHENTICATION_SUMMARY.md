# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive authentication system to enable Lilly to securely access Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, and Google Drive services. This system provides a unified approach to authentication, credential storage, and service integration.

## Components Created

1. **Credential Manager (`credential_manager.py`)**
   - Secure credential storage using Fernet encryption
   - Master password protection with PBKDF2 key derivation
   - Methods for storing, retrieving, and managing credentials

2. **Authentication Framework (`authentication.py`)**
   - Base authentication class with common functionality
   - Service-specific authentication implementations:
     - ProtonMailAuthentication
     - ProtonCalendarAuthentication
     - GoogleDriveAuthentication (with OAuth)
   - AuthenticationProvider factory for getting the right authenticator

3. **Configuration System (`config.py`)**
   - Environment variable support
   - .env file loading
   - Default values and overrides

4. **Command-Line Interface (`cli.py` and `lilly_auth.py`)**
   - Commands for authentication with each service
   - Master password management
   - Listing and managing credentials

5. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive usage guide in `AUTHENTICATION.md`
   - Quick reference in `README.md`
   - Example .env template

6. **Examples**
   - Basic authentication example
   - Service adapter integration

## Authentication Flows

### Proton Mail/Calendar
1. User provides credentials (username/password)
2. Credentials are encrypted and stored
3. When adapters need access, they retrieve and use these credentials
4. Connection is made via Proton Bridge (IMAP/SMTP for mail, CalDAV for calendar)

### Google Drive
1. User provides OAuth client ID and secret
2. System opens browser for Google authentication
3. User grants permissions
4. OAuth tokens are received, encrypted, and stored
5. When adapter needs access, it retrieves and uses these tokens

## Security Features

- All credentials are encrypted at rest
- Master password never stored directly
- Support for environment variables to avoid hardcoding
- Use of PBKDF2 for key derivation with salt
- Option to rotate master password

## Integration with Service Adapters

The authentication system integrates directly with the service adapters:

1. First, authenticate a service using the CLI
2. When instantiating adapters, retrieve credentials from the credential manager
3. Pass credentials to the adapter constructor
4. The adapter uses these credentials to connect to the service

This approach keeps authentication separate from service logic while ensuring secure credential management.

## Next Steps

1. **Adapt Service Implementations**:
   - Update service adapters to accept credential dictionaries
   - Add authentication checks to service operations

2. **Add Refresh Logic**:
   - Implement token refresh for Google Drive
   - Handle authentication errors and retry

3. **Enhance Security**:
   - Add credential validation and expiration checks
   - Implement more robust error handling

4. **User Experience**:
   - Add a simple GUI for authentication
   - Improve error messages and user guidance
