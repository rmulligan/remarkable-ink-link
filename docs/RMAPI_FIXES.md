# ReMarkable API Adapter Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes made to the RmapiAdapter to resolve issues with file downloads and document listing.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. Fixed "file doesn't exist" error during rmapi command execution
2. Improved document listing to handle different output formats
3. Enhanced file download process with multiple fallback approaches
4. Added robust error handling and logging throughout
5. Fixed issues with file path handling and special characters
6. Improved document tag checking with better error handling

## Detailed Changes

### 1. RmapiAdapter.download_file

- Enhanced with multi-step approach to try different download methods:
  - Basic command without quotes
  - Command with quotes around the document name
  - Command with escaped special characters
- Added directory existence checking
- Improved file finding logic to look for files in multiple formats
- Added file validation after download
- Used shutil.copy2 instead of os.rename for better cross-filesystem support
- Added detailed logging at each step

### 2. RmapiAdapter.list_files

- Added support for both simple and detailed listing formats
- Improved parsing of document names and IDs
- Enhanced handling of document types (files vs. collections)
- Added better error handling and logging
- Fixed issues with ID extraction from command output

### 3. RmapiAdapter.find_tagged_notebooks

- Updated to use the improved list_files method
- Fixed document processing logic
- Added better error handling and tracebacks
- Improved logging for easier debugging

### 4. RmapiAdapter._check_document_for_tag

- Added validation of downloaded files
- Added zip file content checking
- Improved JSON parsing with better error handling
- Fixed case-insensitive tag matching
- Added better log file handling
- Enhanced cleanup with error reporting
- Added detailed diagnostics for downloaded files

## Testing

The fixed RmapiAdapter should now handle various scenarios more robustly:
- Documents with special characters in names
- Different rmapi output formats
- Empty or invalid files
- Various error conditions during download

## Future Improvements

1. Add retry logic for intermittent connectivity issues
2. Implement caching for document lists to reduce API calls
3. Add support for hierarchical document navigation
4. Improve ZIP file handling for different formats

These fixes maintain compatibility with the drawj2d-based conversion approach implemented in the codebase cleanup.
