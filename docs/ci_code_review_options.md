# CI Code Review Options

Since Shippie doesn't support GitHub Models directly and requires an OpenAI API key, here are your options:

## Option 1: Use OpenAI with Shippie
1. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` repository secret in GitHub
2. Uncomment the Shippie section in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Option 2: Disable Code Review
The code review step has been commented out in the CI workflow for now.

## Option 3: Use Alternative Solutions
Consider these alternatives that work with GitHub Models:
- GitHub Copilot in the IDE for local code review
- GitHub's built-in PR review features with Copilot suggestions
- Custom GitHub Models integration (see `.github/workflows/code-review-github-models.yml`)

## Option 4: Use Other AI Code Review Tools
- PR-Agent (supports multiple providers)
- CodeRabbit (has a free tier)
- Devin (if you have access)

## Current Status
The CI pipeline is configured to:
1. Run linting and formatting checks
2. Run tests with coverage reporting to DeepSource
3. Build and push Docker images (on main branch)

Code review is currently disabled to avoid CI failures.
