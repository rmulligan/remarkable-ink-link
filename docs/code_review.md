# Code Review Report

## Introduction

This report summarizes the findings of a static code analysis and review of the project. The review covered Python source code, tests, and configuration files, focusing on code smells, anti-patterns, and maintainability issues. Findings are grouped by file and severity, with actionable recommendations provided where appropriate.

## Findings

### src/inklink/server.py
- **Critical**
  - Large monolithic class (`URLHandler`) with many responsibilities (SRP violation).
  - Potential for deeply nested logic in request handlers.
- **Warning**
  - Hardcoded regex for URL validation.
  - Service dependencies are initialized internally, not injected (hard to test/mock).
  - Error handling is present but could be more granular.
- **Minor**
  - Some methods may lack detailed docstrings.

### src/inklink/utils.py
- **Warning**
  - Uses try/except for config import, which may hide config errors.
  - Some functions are long, but generally well-documented.
- **Minor**
  - Fallbacks to default values may mask misconfigurations.

### src/inklink/services/document_service.py (and likely other services)
- **Warning**
  - Logic in `__init__` (side effects, tool checks) reduces testability.
  - Fallback to legacy tools is handled at runtime, which may cause silent failures.
- **Minor**
  - Logging and docstrings are present and generally clear.

### tests/
- **Warning**
  - Some test files are large (e.g., test_document_service.py >400 lines), which may indicate insufficient modularization.
  - No evidence of test coverage for all edge cases or negative scenarios.
- **Minor**
  - Some test functions lack detailed docstrings.

### .flake8
- **Warning**
  - Ignores important errors (e.g., F401 unused imports, F821 undefined names), which can hide real issues.
  - Max line length set to 88 (matches Black), but ignoring E203, W503 may hide style issues.

### .pre-commit-config.yaml
- **Minor**
  - Lacks isort (import sorting) and bandit (security) hooks.
  - Local poetry lock hook is present, but no type-checking or static analysis hooks.

### pyproject.toml
- **Minor**
  - Author field is a placeholder.
  - Google API dependencies are commented out, which may cause runtime errors if features are used.
  - No type-checking tools (e.g., mypy) configured.

### Dockerfile
- **Warning**
  - No multi-stage build (large image size).
  - Runs as root user (security risk).
  - No healthcheck defined.
- **Minor**
  - No explicit resource limits or cleanup for build artifacts.

### docker-compose.yml
- **Warning**
  - No volumes defined for persistence.
  - No healthcheck or resource limits.
- **Minor**
  - Minimal configuration; may be sufficient for dev but not production.

## General Observations
- No evidence of duplicated code in sampled files, but some files are very large.
- Docstring coverage is generally good, but some methods and tests lack detail.
- No obvious hardcoded secrets, but some hardcoded values (e.g., regex, paths).
- No type-checking or security scanning in CI.
- Test coverage appears reasonable but could be more modular and comprehensive.

## Recommendations

- Refactor large classes and functions to improve modularity and maintainability.
- Avoid hardcoded values; use configuration where possible.
- Improve error handling and logging granularity.
- Add missing docstrings and improve documentation detail.
- Enable stricter linting and static analysis in CI.
- Add type-checking and security scanning tools.
- Enhance test coverage, especially for edge and negative cases.
- Improve Docker and Compose files for security and production readiness.
