- Optional integrations: Emacs/org-roam/org-agenda, Motion, Apple Shortcuts

---

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure you have:
- Node.js and Yarn
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Claude CLI (for handwriting recognition)

To install dependencies and set up the local environment, run:

```bash
yarn
```
After installing, set up Git hooks to enforce formatting and dependency locks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will install Python dependencies via Poetry.

For a barebones local install without Docker:

```bash
poetry install
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn install:bare
```

To build and start the application in Docker (default):

```bash
yarn install:docker
```

This will build the Docker image and start the container.

### Deploying on a Raspberry Pi

You can deploy InkLink to a remote Raspberry Pi (e.g., Pi 5 running Ubuntu 24) using the provided script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy_to_pi.sh
scripts/deploy_to_pi.sh
```

This script will:
- SSH into "ryan@100.110.75.57"
- Install Docker and Docker Compose if missing
- Clone or update the InkLink repository in `~/inklink`
- Build the Docker image
- Run the container mapped to port 9999

Ensure your SSH keys are configured for passwordless access.

Once installed, you can:
- Run the app locally: `yarn start`
  
## üîê Authentication

Follow these steps to authenticate your reMarkable account:

1. Start the InkLink server (default on port 9999):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d inklink
   ```

2. In your browser, visit:

   ```
   http://localhost:9999/auth
   ```

3. On the authentication page:
   ‚Ä¢ Click the link to go to the reMarkable device connect page and retrieve your one‚Äëtime code.  
   ‚Ä¢ Paste the code into the form and submit.

InkLink will invoke `rmapi login` under the hood and store your credentials. Once authenticated, you can use the `/share` endpoint to upload documents without additional prompts.

- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Lint code: `yarn lint`
- Format code: `yarn format`

For Docker control:
- Build image: `yarn docker:build`
- Start containers: `yarn docker:up`
- Stop containers: `yarn docker:down`

## üì¨ Using the Web-to-Ink Endpoint

Currently, the main functionality available is the web-to-ink conversion service. Once the server is running:

1. Send a POST request to the `/share` endpoint with a URL to convert
2. The service will:
   - Generate a QR code linking back to the original content
   - Process the content (supporting both web pages and PDFs)
   - Convert to native reMarkable ink format (.rm)
   - Upload to your reMarkable cloud account

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/share -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

Or with a simple request containing just the URL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/share -d "https://example.com"
```

The response will contain success status and a message.

For backward compatibility, the default response is in plain text:
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Webpage uploaded to Remarkable: Example Domain"}
```

If your client includes `Accept: application/json` in the request header, you'll receive a JSON response with a download link:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webpage uploaded to Remarkable: Example Domain",
  "download": "/download/document123.rm"
}
```

### Downloading Generated Documents

You can directly download the converted reMarkable documents using the `/download` endpoint:

```
GET /download/filename.rm
```

This allows you to save and review documents locally without requiring a reMarkable device.

## üìù Handwriting Recognition with Lilly

InkLink uses Claude Vision capabilities through a personified assistant named "Lilly" that processes handwritten content from your reMarkable tablet.

### Features

- Direct handwriting recognition from `.rm` files
- Special tag processing (`#summarize`, `#task`, `#entity`, etc.)
- Knowledge graph integration
- Personalized responses based on context

### Example Commands

Process a single page:
```bash
python -m inklink.main process path/to/file.rm
```

Process an entire notebook:

### Submodules

This repository includes the following Git submodules:

- `src/models/handwriting_model/deep_scribe_original`: Original DeepScribe handwriting model
- `src/models/handwriting_model/maxio`: MaxIO reMarkable integration library

When cloning the repository, use the `--recursive` flag to also clone submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/remarkable-ink-link/inklink.git
```

If you've already cloned the repository without submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Organization Principles

The codebase follows these organization principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between adapters (external integrations), services (core business logic), and API layers
2. **Component-based Testing**: Test files are organized by component type for easier maintenance
3. **Documentation-centric**: Comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory organized by topic
4. **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to be modular and replaceable

## üí° Configuration Options

### PDF Rendering Modes

InkLink supports two PDF rendering modes, configurable via the `INKLINK_PDF_RENDER_MODE` environment variable:

- **`raster`** (default): Renders PDFs as rasterized PNG images. More reliable with complex PDFs but lower quality.
- **`outline`**: Embeds vector outlines from PDFs directly. Higher quality but may fail with complex PDFs.

To change the mode:

```bash
# In Docker
docker-compose up -d -e INKLINK_PDF_RENDER_MODE=outline inklink

# Or set in your environment before running
export INKLINK_PDF_RENDER_MODE=outline
yarn start
```

When using `outline` mode, you can also configure:
- `INKLINK_PDF_PAGE`: Which page to render (default: 1)
- `INKLINK_PDF_SCALE`: Scale factor for rendering (default: 1.0)

### Handwriting Recognition

InkLink uses Claude Vision capabilities through the Claude CLI for handwriting recognition.

To configure, add Claude CLI settings to your environment:

```bash
# Add to your .env file
CLAUDE_COMMAND=claude  # Path to Claude CLI if not in PATH
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229  # Your preferred Claude model with vision capabilities
```

See [Claude Vision Integration](docs/integrations/claude-vision/usage.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## üêû Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error pulling images such as:

```
failed to solve: python:3.10-slim: error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop.exe": executable file not found in $PATH, out: ``
```

open your Docker client configuration file (`~/.docker/config.json`) and remove or disable any `credsStore` or `credHelpers` entries referencing Windows credential helpers. For example:

```json
{
  // ‚Ä¶
  // "credsStore": "desktop.exe",
  // "credHelpers": { ‚Ä¶ }
}
```

Save the file and rerun `docker compose build`.
