# Syntax Highlighting Progress

## Overview
Implementation of the "Claude" color syntax highlighting feature for reMarkable Pro devices is progressing well. This feature will allow annotated code to sync to reMarkable with proper colored syntax highlighting.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & drawj2d Testing ✓
- Created Drawj2dService wrapper class
- Implemented test HCL generation
- Verified drawj2d executable is working
- Created test script `test_drawj2d_basic.py`

### Phase 2: Syntax-to-HCL Compiler ✓
- Created SyntaxHighlightCompiler class
- Implemented basic tokenization for Python and JavaScript
- Added theme support (default_dark, light, custom)
- Created proper HCL generation with drawj2d syntax
- Fixed HCL syntax issues (proper escaping, correct commands)
- All tests passing in `test_syntax_compiler.py`

## Key Components Created

### Services
1. **Drawj2dService** (`/src/inklink/services/drawj2d_service.py`)
   - Wraps drawj2d executable
   - Processes HCL files to generate .rmdoc files
   - Provides test HCL generation

2. **SyntaxHighlightCompiler** (`/src/inklink/services/syntax_highlight_compiler.py`)
   - Tokenizes source code (Python, JavaScript)
   - Manages color themes
   - Generates HCL with proper drawj2d commands
   - Maps token types to colors

### Test Scripts
1. **test_drawj2d_basic.py** - Verifies drawj2d functionality
2. **test_syntax_compiler.py** - Tests tokenization, themes, and HCL generation

## Technical Details

### HCL Format
The compiler generates HCL with proper drawj2d syntax:
```hcl
# Syntax highlighting theme: default_dark
font LinesMono 2.5

m 10 10
pen orange
text {def}
m 30.0 10
pen purple
text {fibonacci}
```

### Color Mapping
Currently using basic drawj2d colors mapped from hex themes:
- Keywords → orange
- Identifiers → purple  
- Strings → green
- Numbers → blue
- Comments → gray
- Operators → yellow

### Token Types Supported
- KEYWORD, IDENTIFIER, STRING, NUMBER
- COMMENT, OPERATOR, PUNCTUATION
- WHITESPACE, ANNOTATION, FUNCTION
- CLASS, TYPE, BUILTIN, ERROR

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Color Syntax Highlighting Engine
- Implement proper scanner with regex patterns
- Add more sophisticated parser
- Support more languages (Java, Go, etc.)
- Handle multi-line strings and comments
- Improve color mapping to use full RGB values

### Phase 4: Advanced Layout & Refinements
- Add page layout calculation
- Implement line numbers
- Handle code wrapping
- Add metadata embedding

### Phase 5: Notebook Integration
- Integrate with AugmentedNotebookService
- Support mixed content (handwriting + syntax highlighting)
- Test different pen modes on reMarkable Pro

### Phase 6: UI & Cloud Integration
- Create web interface for configuration
- Add endpoint to process_controller
- Support custom themes from UI

## Issues Resolved
1. Fixed HCL syntax errors (paper command not recognized)
2. Corrected string escaping for curly braces
3. Mapped theme colors to basic drawj2d pen colors
4. Fixed coordinate system for proper text positioning

## Notes
- The tokenizer is currently basic but functional
- Color mapping is limited to drawj2d's named colors
- Full RGB support will require Phase 3 implementation
- File sizes are reasonable (~10KB for a small Python file)
