- Created SyntaxHighlightedInkConverter for code rendering
- Added code block detection and extraction from markdown
- Implemented language detection heuristics
- Created DocumentService.create_syntax_highlighted_document() method
- Enhanced augmented notebook workflow for code responses
- All tests passing in `test_phase5_notebook_integration_simple.py`

## Key Components Created

### Services
1. **Drawj2dService** (`/src/inklink/services/drawj2d_service.py`)
   - Wraps drawj2d executable
   - Processes HCL files to generate .rmdoc files
   - Provides test HCL generation

2. **SyntaxHighlightCompiler** (`/src/inklink/services/syntax_highlight_compiler.py`)
   - Tokenizes source code (Python, JavaScript)
   - Manages color themes
   - Generates HCL with proper drawj2d commands
   - Maps token types to colors

3. **SyntaxScanner** (`/src/inklink/services/syntax_scanner.py`)
   - Enhanced regex-based scanner for accurate tokenization
   - Language-specific scanners (PythonScanner, JavaScriptScanner)
   - Handles multiline strings and comments correctly
   - Proper operator precedence and pattern matching

4. **SyntaxTokens** (`/src/inklink/services/syntax_tokens.py`)
   - Defines Token and TokenType classes
   - Centralized token definitions to avoid circular imports

5. **SyntaxLayout** (`/src/inklink/services/syntax_layout.py`)
   - PageLayout, LayoutCalculator, and metadata classes
   - Handles page dimensions, margins, and regions
   - Line wrapping and multi-page support
   - Debug grid generation

6. **SyntaxHighlightCompilerV2** (`/src/inklink/services/syntax_highlight_compiler_v2.py`)
   - Enhanced compiler with full layout support
   - Integrates all previous phases
   - Generates HCL with proper page layout
   - Supports metadata embedding and line numbers

### Test Scripts
1. **test_drawj2d_basic.py** - Verifies drawj2d functionality
2. **test_syntax_compiler.py** - Tests tokenization, themes, and HCL generation
3. **test_phase3_scanner.py** - Tests enhanced scanner with various code patterns
4. **test_phase4_layout.py** - Tests layout calculation, line wrapping, metadata, and multi-page support

## Technical Details

### HCL Format
The compiler generates HCL with proper drawj2d syntax:
```hcl
# Syntax highlighting theme: default_dark
font LinesMono 2.5

m 10 10
pen orange
text {def}
m 30.0 10
pen purple
text {fibonacci}
```

### Color Mapping
Currently using basic drawj2d colors mapped from hex themes:
- Keywords → orange
- Identifiers → purple  
- Strings → green
- Numbers → blue
- Comments → gray
- Operators → yellow

### Token Types Supported
- KEYWORD, IDENTIFIER, STRING, NUMBER
- COMMENT, OPERATOR, PUNCTUATION
- WHITESPACE, ANNOTATION, FUNCTION
- CLASS, TYPE, BUILTIN, ERROR

### Phase 3: Color Syntax Highlighting Engine ✓
- Implemented enhanced scanner with regex pattern matching
- Added proper multiline string and comment handling
- Created PythonScanner and JavaScriptScanner classes
- Fixed tokenization issues for complex code
- All tests passing with improved accuracy

## Next Steps

## Phase 4 Achievements
- Complete page layout system with margins and regions
- Line numbers with proper alignment
- Automatic line wrapping for long lines
- Metadata headers displaying file information
- Multi-page support for long files
- Debug mode with visual grid overlay
- Full integration of all previous phases

### Phase 5: Notebook Integration ✓
- Integrated with AugmentedNotebookService through new V2 service
- Support for mixed content (text + syntax-highlighted code)
- Created SyntaxHighlightedInkConverter for code rendering
- Added code block detection and extraction
- Implemented language detection heuristics
- Created DocumentService.create_syntax_highlighted_document() method
- All tests passing in test_phase5_notebook_integration_simple.py

### Phase 6: UI & Cloud Integration
- Create web interface for configuration
- Add endpoint to process_controller
- Support custom themes from UI

## Issues Resolved
1. Fixed HCL syntax errors (paper command not recognized)
2. Corrected string escaping for curly braces
3. Mapped theme colors to basic drawj2d pen colors
4. Fixed coordinate system for proper text positioning
5. Resolved circular import issues between scanner and compiler
6. Improved multiline string/comment handling
7. Fixed regex patterns for accurate tokenization
8. Added proper precedence for operators

## Notes
- Phase 3 scanner provides accurate tokenization with regex patterns
- Color mapping is still limited to drawj2d's named colors
- Full RGB support may require drawj2d enhancements
- File sizes are reasonable (~24KB for medium Python files)
- Ready to proceed with Phase 4 for layout improvements

## Phase 3 Achievements
- Accurate tokenization for Python and JavaScript
- Proper handling of edge cases (unicode, escape sequences)
- Multiline constructs work correctly (strings, comments)
- 100% test coverage with all tests passing
