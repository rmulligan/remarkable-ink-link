# Notebook Memory Management System

This document outlines the design for a memory management system that integrates with reMarkable notebooks, allowing users to create, access, and manage Claude's memories without using the terminal.

## Overview

The Notebook Memory Management System creates a seamless interface for handling Claude's memories directly through reMarkable notebooks. By leveraging the tagging system and folder structure, users can manage AI memories in their natural writing workflow, creating persistent context that enhances AI interactions across sessions.

## Core Concepts

1. **Memory**: A stored piece of information or context that Claude can recall later
2. **Memory Collection**: A group of related memories, organized by topic or project
3. **Memory Tag**: A special tag that triggers memory operations
4. **Memory Page**: A dedicated page for memory management
5. **Memory Persistence**: How memories are stored and maintained between sessions

## Memory Storage Structure

Memories will be stored in a structured format that maintains the connection between reMarkable notebooks and Claude's memory system:

```
/project_root/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md              # Project instructions
│   ├── memories/
│   │   ├── index.json         # Memory index with metadata
│   │   ├── project_alpha/     # Memories by project
│   │   │   ├── memory1.md     # Individual memory file 
│   │   │   └── memory2.md
│   │   ├── project_beta/
│   │   └── global/            # Project-independent memories
│   └── memory_config.json     # Memory configuration file
└── notebooks/                 # Synced reMarkable notebooks
```

## Memory File Structure

Each memory is stored as an individual markdown file with a specific structure:

```markdown

# Understanding Quantum Computing Basics

Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) which can exist in superposition states.
Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can be both simultaneously.

This enables parallel computation for certain problems, providing exponential speedup
compared to classical algorithms.

Key concepts include:
- Superposition
- Entanglement
- Quantum gates
- Quantum circuits
```

## Memory Index Structure

The `index.json` file maintains a searchable index of all memories:

```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_01h2g3k4p5q6r7s8t9u0v1w2x",
      "title": "Understanding Quantum Computing Basics",
      "path": "project_alpha/memory1.md",
      "created": "2023-05-10T15:30:00Z",
      "updated": "2023-05-15T09:45:00Z",
      "source": "Quantum Computing Notebook, Page 7",
      "tags": ["quantum", "computing", "basics"],
      "importance": "high",
      "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
      "notebook_id": "5f7b8a9c-1e2d-3f4g-5h6i-7j8k9l0m1n2o"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Memory Operations

Users can perform the following memory operations through the tagging system:

### 1. Creating Memories

**Creating memories from notebook content:**

When a page is tagged with `#mem:create`, the system extracts the content and creates a new memory. Parameters can specify details:

- `#mem:create:title=Quantum Basics` - Creates a memory with the specified title
- `#mem:create:tags=quantum,basics` - Adds tags to the memory
- `#mem:create:importance=high` - Sets importance level

**Example Workflow:**
1. User writes notes about quantum computing
2. User tags the page with `#mem:create:title=Quantum Basics:tags=science,quantum`
3. When synced, the system extracts the content and creates a memory file
4. The memory is indexed and made available to Claude

### 2. Retrieving Memories

**Accessing existing memories:**

Users can retrieve memories using search tags:

- `#mem:recall:title=Quantum` - Recalls memories with "Quantum" in the title
- `#mem:recall:tags=quantum,basics` - Recalls memories with specific tags
- `#mem:recall:recent=5` - Recalls the 5 most recent memories
- `#mem:recall:all` - Lists all available memories

**Example Workflow:**
1. User tags a blank page with `#mem:recall:tags=quantum`
2. When synced, the system retrieves matching memories
3. The memories are rendered to the page in the notebook
4. User can now review and annotate the retrieved memories

### 3. Updating Memories

**Modifying existing memories:**

Users can update memories by tagging pages that contain the memory:

- `#mem:update:id=mem_01h2g3k4p5q6r7s8t9u0v1w2x` - Updates the specified memory
- `#mem:update:title=Quantum Basics` - Updates memory with matching title

**Example Workflow:**
1. User recalls a memory using `#mem:recall:title=Quantum Basics`
2. User annotates or edits the content
3. User tags the page with `#mem:update:title=Quantum Basics`
4. When synced, the system updates the memory with the new content

### 4. Deleting Memories

**Removing unwanted memories:**

Users can delete memories using specific tags:

- `#mem:delete:id=mem_01h2g3k4p5q6r7s8t9u0v1w2x` - Deletes the specified memory
- `#mem:delete:title=Quantum Basics` - Deletes memory with matching title

**Example Workflow:**
1. User tags a page with `#mem:delete:title=Quantum Basics`
2. When synced, the system removes the memory
3. A confirmation is noted in the sync log

### 5. Organizing Memories

**Managing memory collections:**

Users can organize memories into collections:

- `#mem:organize:collection=Physics` - Creates or assigns to a collection
- `#mem:organize:merge=Quantum,Computing` - Merges collections

**Example Workflow:**
1. User tags a page with `#mem:organize:collection=Physics:ids=mem_01,mem_02`
2. When synced, the system organizes the specified memories into the collection
3. The collections structure is updated in the index

## Memory Page Templates

The system will provide specialized page templates for memory management:

1. **Memory Creation Template**:
   - Structured sections for title, content, tags, and importance
   - Checkbox for making the memory persistent
   - Area for related memories

2. **Memory Recall Template**:
   - Search parameters area
   - Display space for retrieved memories
   - Action buttons for update/delete operations

3. **Memory Dashboard Template**:
   - Overview of available memory collections
   - Recent memory activity
   - Memory statistics and health

## Memory Synchronization Process

1. **Detection Phase**:
   - System detects memory-related tags during synchronization
   - Tags are parsed and validated

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Memory operations are performed based on tags
   - Memory files are created/updated/deleted as needed
   - Memory index is updated

3. **Feedback Phase**:
   - Results of memory operations are captured
   - Feedback is included in the sync log
   - If requested, confirmation is rendered to the notebook

## Memory Persistence and Storage

Memories are stored with three levels of persistence:

1. **Transient**: Available only for the current session
2. **Project**: Available for all notebooks in the current project
3. **Global**: Available across all projects

The persistence level can be specified with the `scope` parameter:
- `#mem:create:scope=transient` - Creates a transient memory
- `#mem:create:scope=project` - Creates a project-level memory (default)
- `#mem:create:scope=global` - Creates a global memory

## Memory Search and Retrieval

Memory retrieval supports several search methods:

1. **Metadata Search**: Title, tags, dates, importance
2. **Content Search**: Full-text search within memory content
3. **Semantic Search**: Finding conceptually similar memories using embeddings
4. **Source-based Search**: Finding memories from a specific notebook or page

When searching semantically, the system generates embeddings for the query and compares them with stored memory embeddings to find conceptually similar content.

## Integration with Claude

The memory system integrates with Claude through:

1. **Memory Context Inclusion**:
   - Relevant memories are automatically included in Claude's context
   - Memory importance and recency affect prioritization
   - Project context determines which memories are accessible

2. **Memory Operations via Claude**:
   - Claude can interpret memory tags and perform operations
   - Claude can suggest relevant memories based on current content
   - Claude can create and organize memories based on conversation

3. **Memory-Aware Responses**:
   - Claude's responses reflect awareness of stored memories
   - Claude can reference specific memories in responses
   - Claude can explain which memories influenced its response

## Memory Visualization

To help users understand and navigate their memory space, the system provides visualizations:

1. **Memory Map**: Graph visualization showing connections between memories
2. **Memory Timeline**: Chronological view of memory creation and updates
3. **Memory Heatmap**: Visual representation of memory usage and importance
4. **Memory Clusters**: Grouping of semantically similar memories

These visualizations can be generated on request using tags like:
- `#mem:visualize:type=map` - Generates a memory map
- `#mem:visualize:type=timeline` - Generates a memory timeline

## Memory Analytics

The system provides analytics to help users understand and optimize their memory usage:

1. **Memory Health**: Overall status of the memory system
2. **Memory Usage**: Statistics on memory creation and access
3. **Memory Effectiveness**: How memories are improving AI interactions
4. **Memory Recommendations**: Suggestions for memory organization

Analytics can be requested with tags like:
- `#mem:analytics:type=health` - Generates memory health analytics
- `#mem:analytics:type=usage` - Generates memory usage analytics
