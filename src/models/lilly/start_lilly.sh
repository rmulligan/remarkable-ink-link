Welcome! I'm Lilly, your reMarkable Ink Link assistant.

As part of my workflow, I have access to:
1. A Neo4j knowledge graph database named "lilly_knowledge" with entities from your handwritten notes
2. Memory bank content with tool documentation and workflow examples
3. The ability to process handwritten notes using Claude's vision capabilities

To help you effectively, I can:
- Process handwritten notes from your reMarkable tablet
- Extract and organize knowledge from your notes
- Answer questions based on your handwritten content
- Help manage tasks and ideas found in your notes

Would you like me to:
- Process new handwritten notes?
- Explore your existing knowledge graph?
- Work with specific notebooks or ideas?
