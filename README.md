## üöÄ What is InkLink?

InkLink is an open-source toolkit that transforms your reMarkable tablet into an AI-augmented thought partner. It bridges paper-like thinking with intelligent workflows ‚Äî no browser tabs, no distractions.

### ‚ú® Core Features

- **üß† AI-Augmented Notes:** Ask questions directly from handwritten notes. Receive structured, editable responses in `.rm` format.
- **üåê Web-to-Ink Sharing:** Send web content to your tablet and convert it to editable *native ink*, not static text or PDFs. Move, resize, clip, and restructure AI-generated or imported text as if you'd written it by hand.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Hybrid Handwriting Recognition:** Fast, accurate transcription powered by MyScript iink SDK, with optional verification using local vision models for improved accuracy.
- **üè∑Ô∏è UI-Based Tag Actions:** Tag content through the user interface and trigger workflows like summarization, calendar integration, and more.
- **üìÖ Task & Calendar Integration:** Detect tasks in your notes and sync them with your calendar (e.g. Motion, org-agenda).
- **üóÇ Smart Indexing:** Generate and maintain table of contents, index pages, and note links using symbols or QR codes.
- **üîå Modular AI Workflows (MCP-ready):** Supports Multi-Connection Protocol (MCP) for real-time agent communication and toolchain integration.
- **‚òÅÔ∏è One-Click reMarkable Setup:** Connect to your reMarkable account with a single click using the "Device Link" flow ‚Äî no terminal, no token copy-pasting, no dev skills required.
- **üîÑ Automatic Sync & Tag-Driven Actions:** Notes sync automatically from your reMarkable. Tags like `#summarize`, `#task`, or `#calendar` trigger AI-powered workflows with no extra steps.
- **üß† Visual Knowledge Graph:** Automatically generate a personal knowledge graph from your notes ‚Äî powered by entity recognition, backlinks, and concept clustering.

---

## üì∑ Example Use Cases

- Send a web article or AI-generated summary to your reMarkable and edit it as ink ‚Äî rearrange, clip, highlight, and remix it freely without breaking your writing flow.
- Write a to-do list by hand and sync tasks with your calendar automatically.
- Ask a handwritten question and receive an answer in native ink format ‚Äî ready to move, rephrase, or expand with a pen.
- Add `#summarize` to a dense page and get a clean summary beside it, ready to rearrange in ink.
- Use `#calendar` in a note and have appointments sync to your external calendar.
- Explore your evolving thoughts in a live visual knowledge graph powered by your handwriting.

## üõ† Architecture Overview

- Languages: Python + Ruby (CLI + backend utilities)
- One-click Device Link setup via reMarkable Cloud API
- Ink rendering via `drawj2d` to preserve native editing experience
- Handwriting recognition with **MyScript** (primary), plus optional **vision model verification**
- AI orchestration using Flowise, LangChain, or OpenAI APIs
- Modular messaging via MCP (Multi-Connection Protocol)
- Tag-based AI triggers (`#summarize`, `#calendar`, `#index`, etc.)
- Background sync engine with customizable frequency and event-based triggers
- Optional integrations: Emacs/org-roam/org-agenda, Motion, Apple Shortcuts

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure you have:
- Node.js and Yarn
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

To install dependencies and set up the local environment, run:

```bash
yarn
```
After installing, set up Git hooks to enforce formatting and dependency locks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will install Python dependencies via Poetry.

For a barebones local install without Docker:

```bash
poetry install
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn install:bare
```

To build and start the application in Docker (default):

```bash
yarn install:docker
```

This will build the Docker image and start the container.

### Deploying on a Raspberry Pi

You can deploy InkLink to a remote Raspberry Pi (e.g., Pi¬†5 running Ubuntu¬†24) using the provided script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy_to_pi.sh
scripts/deploy_to_pi.sh
```

This script will:
- SSH into "ryan@100.110.75.57"
- Install Docker and Docker Compose if missing
- Clone or update the InkLink repository in `~/inklink`
- Build the Docker image
- Run the container mapped to port 9999

Ensure your SSH keys are configured for passwordless access.

Once installed, you can:
- Run the app locally: `yarn start`
  
## üîê Authentication

Follow these steps to authenticate your reMarkable account:

1. Start the InkLink server (default on port¬†9999):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d inklink
   ```

2. In your browser, visit:

   ```
   http://localhost:9999/auth
   ```

3. On the authentication page:
   ‚Ä¢ Click the link to go to the reMarkable device connect page and retrieve your one‚Äëtime code.  
   ‚Ä¢ Paste the code into the form and submit.

InkLink will invoke `rmapi login` under the hood and store your credentials. Once authenticated, you can use the `/share` endpoint to upload documents without additional prompts.

- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Lint code: `yarn lint`
- Format code: `yarn format`

For Docker control:
- Build image: `yarn docker:build`
- Start containers: `yarn docker:up`
- Stop containers: `yarn docker:down`

## üì¨ Using the Web-to-Ink Endpoint

Currently, the main functionality available is the web-to-ink conversion service. Once the server is running:

1. Send a POST request to the `/share` endpoint with a URL to convert
2. The service will:
   - Generate a QR code linking back to the original content
   - Process the content (supporting both web pages and PDFs)
   - Convert to native reMarkable ink format (.rm)
   - Upload to your reMarkable cloud account

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/share -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

Or with a simple request containing just the URL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/share -d "https://example.com"
```

The response will contain success status and a message:
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Webpage uploaded to Remarkable: Example Domain"}
```

## üîå Integrations

InkLink is built with modularity in mind. Through MCP, it can connect to external tools and services like calendars, research agents, or lifelogging platforms.

Standalone integration modules (coming soon):
- `inklink-mcp-limitless`: Sync lifelog entries from the Limitless Pendant and convert them into editable ink for review, summarization, or planning.

> Want to build your own? Stay tuned for the `inklink-mcp-template` to roll your own plug-ins.

## ü™™ License

MIT License ‚Äî permissive and open.  
You are free to use, modify, extend, and build commercial or personal tools on top of InkLink. We may provide a hosted version in the future, but the core will always remain open and community-driven.

## üêû Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error pulling images such as:

```
failed to solve: python:3.10-slim: error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop.exe": executable file not found in $PATH, out: ``
```

open your Docker client configuration file (`~/.docker/config.json`) and remove or disable any `credsStore` or `credHelpers` entries referencing Windows credential helpers. For example:

```json
{
  // ‚Ä¶
  // "credsStore": "desktop.exe",
  // "credHelpers": { ‚Ä¶ }
}
```

Save the file and rerun `docker compose build`.
