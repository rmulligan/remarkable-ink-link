# Repository Cleanup and Organization Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to clean up and organize the reMarkable Ink Link repository.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Repository Structure Analysis**
   - Identified key areas for organization
   - Analyzed main code structure and dependencies
   - Mapped out documentation needs

2. **File Organization**
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude temporary and generated files
   - Created documentation directory structure
   - Moved test files to the proper test directory with appropriate categorization
   - Created cleanup script for temporary files

3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Restructured documentation for better navigation
   - Created new documentation for Claude vision capabilities
   - Added organization plan for ongoing work
   - Added implementation plan for replacing MyScript with Claude vision

## New Files

- `ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan for repository organization
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Plan for replacing MyScript with Claude vision
- `scripts/cleanup_temp_files.sh` - Script to safely clean up temporary files
- `docs/integrations/claude-vision/` - New documentation for Claude vision integration

## Directory Structure

The repository now follows this structure:

```

├── src/                         # Main source code
├── tests/                       # Organized test suite

└── web/                         # Web UI components
```

## Migration to Claude Vision

The repository has been prepared for migrating from MyScript to Claude vision for handwriting recognition:

1. **Documentation**: Initial documentation for the Claude vision approach is in `docs/integrations/claude-vision/`
2. **Implementation Plan**: Detailed plans in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
3. **Cleanup**: MyScript-related files have been identified for later removal

## How to Use the Cleanup Script

The cleanup script safely moves files to backup directories instead of deleting them:

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
./scripts/cleanup_temp_files.sh

# Verify your application still works before permanent deletion
# To permanently delete backup directories (OPTIONAL):
find . -name '.backup' -type d -exec rm -rf {} \; 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Next Steps

1. **Code Refactoring**: Implement the Claude vision adapter and services
2. **Testing**: Update tests to work with the new vision-based approach
3. **Further Documentation**: Complete user and developer guides
4. **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove MyScript dependencies once the new system is tested

## Important Notes

- `.gitignore` has been updated to prevent committing temporary files
- Test files are now organized by category in the `tests/` directory
- Claude vision capabilities will replace MyScript handwriting recognition
- Documentation structure follows a user/developer/integration model
